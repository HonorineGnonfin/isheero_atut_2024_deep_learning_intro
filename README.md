# Deep Learning course: labs and Home Assignement Notebooks

This course is being taught at as part of [ATUT-Isheero 2024 program](https://t.ly/E0Pye?trk=public_post_reshare-text). 
## Table of contents

The course covers the basics of Deep Learning, with a focus on practice.

### Lab and Home Assignment Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks for the labs can be found in the `labs` folder of
the [github repository](https://github.com/srtj89/isheero_atut_2024_deep_learning_intro):

    git clone https://github.com/srtj89/isheero_atut_2024_deep_learning_intro.git

These notebooks only work with `keras and tensorflow`. It is only tested with [Google Colab](https://colab.google/).
